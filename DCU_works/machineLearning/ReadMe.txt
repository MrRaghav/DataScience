Video memorability has various applications.

In this project, features extracted by a different team have been utlized to predict the short- and long-term memorability of the videos.

Features used: 
--------------
HMP
C3D
C3D with HMP
captions using count vectorizer
captions using tf-idf
captions with HMP
captions with C3D

Neural Network 

After analyzing the spearman's score for all of them, the best regressor was used for the test set.
